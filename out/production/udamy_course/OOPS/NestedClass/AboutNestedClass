🔷 Nested Class in Java
📌 Definition---->A class inside another class is called a Nested Class.

👉 Simply:

class Outer {
    class Inner {
    }
}

🎯 Why Do We Need Nested Class?

To logically group classes.
Increase encapsulation.
Improve code readability.
Useful when inner class is only needed by outer class.

📂 Types of Nested Classes

There are two main types:

1️⃣ Non-Static Nested Class (Inner Class)
2️⃣ Static Nested Class

And inner classes are further divided into:

Member Inner Class
Local Inner Class
Anonymous Inner Class
We will understand each clearly.

1️⃣ Member Inner Class (Non-Static)
📖 Definition-->A class declared inside another class without static keyword.

✅ Example
class Outer {
    int x = 10;

    class Inner {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Outer x = " + x);
        }
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer obj = new Outer();
        Outer.Inner in = obj.new Inner();
        in.show();
    }
}

🔎 Important Points

✔ Inner class can access outer class variables (even private).
✔ Need outer class object to create inner class object.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Outer class = Car 🚗
Inner class = Engine 🔧

Engine cannot exist without Car.

2️⃣ Static Nested Class
📖 Definition--->A class declared inside another class with static keyword.

✅ Example
class Outer {
    static int x = 100;

    static class Inner {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Value = " + x);
        }
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();
        obj.show();
    }
}

🔎 Important Points

✔ Does NOT need outer class object.
✔ Can access only static members of outer class.

🧠 Analogy

Static nested class is like a separate department inside company,
but it doesn’t need company owner object.

3️⃣ Local Inner Class

Declared inside a method.

✅ Example
class Outer {
    void display() {

        class Inner {
            void show() {
                System.out.println("Inside method");
            }
        }

        Inner obj = new Inner();
        obj.show();
    }
}

🔎 Rule

Can access final or effectively final local variables.

4️⃣ Anonymous Inner Class

Class without name.Used when we want to override method quickly.

✅ Example
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Runnable obj = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Anonymous Class");
            }
        };

        obj.run();
    }
}
