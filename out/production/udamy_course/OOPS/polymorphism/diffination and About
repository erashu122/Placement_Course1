Polymorphism means: One thing behaving in multiple forms.

In Java: A single method or object can behave differently depending on the situation.

🧠 Break the Word

Poly = Many
Morphism = Forms

So: 👉 Many forms

🔥 Real-Life Example
Think about a person:

As a Father
As a Employee
As a Friend

Same person, different behavior.That is polymorphism.

🟢 Types of Polymorphism in Java
There are two types:

1️⃣ Compile-time Polymorphism --> (Early binding )(Method Overloading)
2️⃣ Runtime Polymorphism --> (Late binding ) (Method Overriding)
