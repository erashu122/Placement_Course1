🔑 final Keyword in Java
📌 Definition:-->final is a non-access modifier in Java that is used to restrict modification.
👉 Once something is declared as final, it cannot be changed.

🎯 Where Can We Use final?

Final Variable
Final Method
Final Class

We’ll understand each one clearly.

1️⃣ Final Variable
📖 Meaning---> If a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed once assigned.
It becomes a constant.

🧠 Real-World Analogy

Think of final variable like your Date of Birth.
Once fixed → it can’t change.

✅ Syntax
final int age = 20;

🔍 Example
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int x = 10;
        // x = 20;  ❌ Error: cannot change value
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

🔎 Step-by-step:

final int x = 10; → x is fixed.
If you try x = 20; → Compile-time error.

Because final variable cannot be reassigned.

⚠ Important Points
You must initialize final variable once.
It can be initialized:
    1. At declaration
    2. Inside constructor (for instance variables)

2️⃣ Final Method
📖 Meaning--->If a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden in subclass.

🧠 Real-Life Example

Imagine a rule made by the principal that cannot be changed by teachers.
That’s a final method 😄

✅ Syntax
final void show() {
    System.out.println("Hello");
}

🔍 Example
class Parent {
    final void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent Method");
    }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    // void display() { } ❌ Error: cannot override final method
}

🔎 Explanation:

display() is final in Parent.
Child class cannot override it.
Java gives compile-time error.

3️⃣ Final Class
📖 Meaning--->If a class is declared as final, it cannot be inherited.

🧠 Real-World Example

Think of it like a sealed box.
No one can open or extend it.

✅ Syntax
final class A {
}

🔍 Example
final class Animal {
}

class Dog extends Animal {  // ❌ Error
}

🔎 Explanation:

Animal is final.
No class can extend it.
Compile-time error.

📌 Best Real Example in Java
String class is final.
public final class String

Because:
Java does not want anyone to modify String behavior.

For security & immutability.
🚀 Common Mistakes Students Make

❌ Trying to change final variable
❌ Overriding final method
❌ Extending final class
